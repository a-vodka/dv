Data Set Information:

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study 
adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City 
in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one 
university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To 
build a FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. 
These 748 donor data, each one included R (Recency - months since last 
donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood 
donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable 
representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating 
blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).

Attribute Information:

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief 
description. The "Blood Transfusion Service Center" is a classification problem. 
The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of 
the database.

R (Recency - months since last donation),
F (Frequency - total number of donation),
M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.),
T (Time - months since first donation), and
a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 
stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).


Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the data. We selected 500 data at 
random as the training set, and the rest 248 as the testing set.
