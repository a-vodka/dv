# Algorithms and models for data collection, analysis, and visualization (Mathematical methods of data visualization)

This course covers a wide spectrum of mathematical models of data visualization topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Beginning with an overview of chart types and potential misrepresentations, it proceeds to explore Python libraries, software tools, and specialized plots. The course delves into advanced domains, discussing the visualization of fields, vectors, tensors, tree structures, and graph representations. It also covers dimension reduction methods, text data visualization using LaTeX, and the principles of effective infographic design. With practical examples and comparisons, the course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of data visualization for effective communication.
